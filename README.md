# FFT Large Integer Multiplication implemented in Racket

This is an implementation of the [Schonhage-Strassen Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhage%E2%80%93Strassen_algorithm) that uses the Fast Fourier Transform to multiply numbers of arbitrary length and precision.


The following guide was followed: [FFT based multiplication of large numbers](http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/Algorithms/fft.html)
